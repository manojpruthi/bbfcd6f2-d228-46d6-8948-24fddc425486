This program is for creating a longest increasing sequence

Program.cs class is the code file which contains logic.

For unit testing, as of now I have executed the code on online c# compiler. I have created a document which have screenshots of executed test cases. If required, we can also write code for unit test cases. I also found some discrepancies in the expected output shared by you. Some of the expected outputs shared by you is not giving correct longest increasing sequence.
